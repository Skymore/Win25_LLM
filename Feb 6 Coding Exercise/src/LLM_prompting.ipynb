        "\n",
        "1. **Overall Accuracy**\n",
        "- The model achieved 46.46% accuracy on the 5-class classification task\n",
        "- This is notably better than random guessing (20%), but still shows room for improvement\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Class-specific Performance**\n",
        "- **Success**: High precision (0.80) but low recall (0.10), suggesting conservative but accurate predictions\n",
        "- **Courage**: Strong recall (1.00) with moderate precision (0.62), indicating good detection but some false positives\n",
        "- **Growth**: Perfect precision (1.00) but low recall (0.33), showing very selective but accurate predictions\n",
        "- **Time_management** and **Persistence**: Generally weaker performance across metrics\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Key Observations**\n",
        "- The confusion matrix shows significant misclassification between related concepts\n",
        "- Most misclassifications occur with 'success' and 'courage' categories\n",
        "- The model struggles with distinguishing between semantically similar categories\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Conclusion**\n",
        "While SBERT shows promise with certain categories, its overall performance (46.46%) suggests that simple embedding similarity might not be sufficient for this nuanced classification task. The model performs best when categories are semantically distinct but struggles with overlapping concepts.\n"
